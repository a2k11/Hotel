### Hotel - A simple ruby application

  * Run ruby main.rb to start the application.
  * The application reads in a list of hotels in a .csv file from the current
    directory.
  * Then, the user is asked which of the hotels they would be interested in.
  * When the user enters the hotel name of their choice, the program will
    respond with the information from one of the hotels listed.
  * If the user answers with a hotel name that is not found, a null hotel is
    returned.
